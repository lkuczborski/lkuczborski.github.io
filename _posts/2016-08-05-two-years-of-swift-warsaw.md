It's been two years since our first meetup. A lot of things happend in the meantime. We have a new place for our meetups (Thanks [Syncano](https://www.syncano.io)!), new sponsors ([Syncano](https://www.syncano.io), [10clouds](http://10clouds.com), [Macoscope](http://macoscope.com)), we changed our logo. But what is most important is that we grew. A lot.

[Swift Warsaw](http://www.meetup.com/Swift-Warsaw/) has now over 400(!) members. **PEOPLE**. This is why I decided to create this meetup in the first place. Community behind Swift Warsaw is awesome. I would like to thank all the speakers (always looking for new ones!) üëè. There is never too late to learn. So come, join us, share the experience and have fun! We even created an official [Slack group](https://sw-slack.herokuapp.com) to make it easier for you.

So, Swift Warsaw is now bigger than ever. But this is only the beginning. And I hope many more meetups are ahead of us! üçª
