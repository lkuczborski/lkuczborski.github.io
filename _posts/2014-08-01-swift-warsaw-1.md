So we met yesterday at [Macoscope](http://macoscope.com) HQ for **Swift Warsaw #1** event. And it went great! I would like to thank all for coming. It was really great to meet such a big crowd of Swifters and to-be-Swifters :) Hope our community will grow even further, see you at our next meetup (TBA soon)! üí¨üç∫üëç

In the meantime here are the slides from yesterday's talks:
